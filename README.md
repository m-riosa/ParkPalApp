# ParkPalApp
App made for theme-park goers to check current wait times to better plan vacations. This app was developed in Flutter.


This was an app created as part of a full-stack application done in University. The app was made entirely by me, my groupmates handled the database creation, API endpoints, as well as the web application.

The app allows two main actions:
  1. Search for a theme park and view the current wait times for the rides in this park and compare them with the average historical wait times to see if it is a good time to go to the ride.
  2. Plan trips to a park. When planning trips the user is allowed to select a park and they are presented with all of the possible rides. When adding a ride to a trip the average wait times are totaled up so the user has an idea of how long their current plan is.


API used for theme park information: https://queue-times.com
